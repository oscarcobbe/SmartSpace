# Manual Action Checklist — Things only Nigel can do

Tasks that need a login, a phone, or a business decision. Code can't do these. Listed in priority order.

## 🔴 Do this week (high impact)

### 1. Phone call: Helen O'Reilly + John Caffrey + Cecile Grand

The dashboard reverse-engineers their variant choices from amount paid, but two of them have ambiguous "Yes wired OR No doorbell at all" answers. Quick disambiguation:

- **John Caffrey** — `+353894163530` — install on **Fri 15 May 10:00–12:00**. Confirm: existing wired doorbell or no doorbell at all?
- **Cecile Grand** — Stripe receipt has her contact details — install was 4/29 (already past). **Phone-call apology + reschedule.**
- **Helen O'Reilly** — `+353868443500` — install on **Tue 12 May 15:00–17:00**. Confirm her power-option choice if anything's unclear ("No New Cabling Required" was the unique match — likely fine without a call).

### 2. Set up Stripe webhook health alerts (30 sec, in Stripe Dashboard)

Stripe → **Developers → Webhooks → click your endpoint → "Notification email" or "Webhook event failure" notification setting**. Add `nigel@smart-space.ie`. Stripe will email you if 3+ consecutive deliveries fail. Without this, a webhook secret rotation or signing-secret mismatch goes silent for 3 days.

### 3. Resubmit sitemap to Google Search Console

Search Console → Sitemaps → if `sitemap.xml` is already submitted, click ⋯ → **Refresh**. If not, paste `sitemap.xml` and submit. Today's deploy added 6 new URLs (privacy, terms, blog index, 3 blog posts, FAQ). Refresh nudges Google to re-crawl within 24-48h.

### 4. Google Ads negative keywords audit

Google Ads → **Tools → Search terms** (in your active campaign) → look at the last 30 days of search terms that triggered your ads. Add as Negative Keywords every term that's irrelevant — e.g.:

- `ring tone`, `ringtone`, `ring fitness tracker`, `ring app`
- `nest thermostat` (if you don't install thermostats)
- `eufy battery`, `eufy app issue` (support intent, not buy intent)
- `diy install`, `how to install ring myself`
- `cheap`, `free` (low-intent qualifiers — debatable, depends on data)
- Brand misspellings of competitors

Setting these as **campaign-level negatives** stops them from eating budget. ~30 minutes for a thorough first pass.

## 🟡 Do next 2 weeks (medium impact)

### 5. Implement /ring-installation LP fixes (separate audit was produced earlier)

The agent audit produced a P0/P1/P2 list. The single biggest lever flagged was:
- Phone number invisible above the fold → add tap-to-dial CTA in the hero
- "Add to Cart" disabled until date+slot picked → reverse the friction

Tell Claude to ship them when you're ready. Each one is ~15 min of code.

### 6. Cloudflare Turnstile (only if honeypot stops being enough)

If after 2 weeks of the honeypot you still see 1+ gibberish entries per week, layer Turnstile on top. Free tier:
1. Cloudflare account → Turnstile → Add site → `smart-space.ie`
2. Get site key (public) + secret key (private)
3. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` and `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` to Vercel
4. Tell Claude to wire it into `ContactForm.tsx` + `/api/contact`

### 7. Set up Twilio SMS for high-value paid orders

Code is already deployed (`src/lib/sms.ts`) and graceful-no-ops without credentials. To activate:

1. Create Twilio account, buy an Irish (or US) number (~€1.50/month + ~€0.05/SMS)
2. Get Account SID + Auth Token from Twilio console
3. Add to Vercel env:
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` (the purchased number, E.164 format e.g. `+35315551234`)
   - `TWILIO_TO_NUMBER` (your phone, E.164 format e.g. `+35389...`)
4. Redeploy
5. Next paid order ≥ €100 will SMS you within 5 seconds

Total cost at current order volume: <€5/month.

### 8. GA4 internal-traffic filter (clean up bot/test noise)

GA4 Admin → **Data Settings → Data Filters → Create**:
1. Filter type: **Internal traffic** → exclude IPs of known internal users (your office Wi-Fi, your phone hotspot)
2. Optionally a second filter for **Developer traffic** to exclude the `traffic_type=internal` parameter

This won't kill the Singapore/Romania bot traffic, but it cleans your own clicks out so engagement metrics reflect real prospects.

To exclude bot traffic from non-target countries: GA4 doesn't expose country filtering directly. Best option is to create an **Audience** for "IE only" and run reports against that audience — see GA4 → Admin → Audiences.

### 9. Google Business Profile refresh

5-minute thing, big map-pack signal:

1. business.google.com → log in → manage your Smart Space listing
2. Add 3 fresh photos (recent install, your van, a happy customer)
3. Post a "What's New" update (e.g., "Ring video doorbell installation across Dublin — €299 fully fitted")
4. Confirm hours, service area, and primary category are correct

## 🟢 Lower priority (do when you have time)

### 10. Trustpilot widget on /reviews

If you have a Trustpilot business profile:
1. Trustpilot → Integrations → TrustBox → grab the embed code
2. Tell Claude where on /reviews to drop it

If you don't have a Trustpilot profile yet, **claim one** — it's a real ranking signal and lets you show external reviews next to your self-hosted ones. Free tier is fine.

### 11. Repeat-customer / referral program

Possible structures:
- 10% commission to past customers for any referral that converts (~€30 on a €299 install)
- Or a flat €50 thank-you voucher for them
- Tracked manually for now; if it works, formalise later

This is a business decision, not a code change. Once you decide, Claude can add a "Refer a friend" CTA to the post-purchase email + a referral form.

### 12. /ring-installation LP audit P1 + P2 items

The audit produced a longer list of medium-impact recommendations: customer photos / installer face, price comparison anchors, "Not sure" option on configurator, WhatsApp fallback, etc. Tell Claude when you want to ship these.
